### 👋 Why I Created This

I've recently been exploring books in areas beyond science and technology, like psychology, philosophy, and self-improvement. As I read, I find it helpful to break down and summarize the main ideas for quick reference and real-life application. This repository is a way to share those insights with you—organized in a clear and practical way so they’re easy to understand and use.
